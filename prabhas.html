        Quotes
        <br>
        Everything else is irrelevant after the bliss of giving a perfect shot
        Audiences remember you because of your work, so I believe in working hard through my films.
        <br>
        I still have that South Indian accent. But I am working on it.
        <br>
         Hindi audiences should feel that I am speaking like them and should relate to me.
